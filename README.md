Echo TCP Server
This project features a simple TCP server that receives messages and echoes them back to the client. Unlike a server, the client establishes a connection using the connect() method to link directly to the server's address.

NOTE: Ensure that the server and client scripts run in separate terminal windows.

Technologies Used
Python
Follow these steps to set up and run the Echo TCP Server:

# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/<https://github.com/AkshitshahOP>

# In one terminal, start the server
python server.py

# In another terminal, start the client
python client.py
